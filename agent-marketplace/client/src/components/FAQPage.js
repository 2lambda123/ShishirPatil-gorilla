      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div className="faqQuestion">What is the Agent Marketplace?</div>
      <div className="faqAnswer">The Agent Marketplace is a centralized platform where users can easily search for, discover, and deploy a variety of LLM (Large Language Model) agents for tasks such as productivity, automation, data retrieval, and more. Although numerous agents have been developed integrating both LLMs and APIs, the absence of a unified platform has limited their exposure and utilization. Through the marketplace, these agents gain increased exposure to the open-source community, allowing users to leverage them to automate daily tasks or build complex applications.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">What are the benefits of using LLM agents?</div>
      <div className="faqAnswer">LLM agents offer expanded functionality by allowing interaction with external systems and APIs, improved accuracy by providing relevant and up-to-date context, and automation of repetitive tasks to enhance efficiency.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">How can I use the agents available in the marketplace?</div>
      <div className="faqAnswer">Users can interact with agents through their individual cards on the homepage. Each agent includes a detailed ReadMe file with instructions for use, which may involve providing an OpenAI API key and following setup steps on how to run the agent source code.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">Where are the agents sourced from?</div>

      <div className="faqAnswer">Yes, contributions are encouraged. Users can submit their own agents through the marketplace interface or via GitHub pull requests. Detailed instructions for submitting agents are available on the platform.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">Is there a limit to the number of agents I can use?</div>
      <div className="faqAnswer">No, there is no limit. Users can access and utilize as many agents as needed to enhance their productivity and task automation.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">How are the agents categorized?</div>
      <div className="faqAnswer">The agents are categorized into practical categories such as Communication, Finance, Data, and AI, making it easier for users to find agents suited to their specific needs.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">How can I deploy the agents?</div>
      <div className="faqAnswer">Each agent comes with a description and a ReadMe file with instructions on how to deploy it. Users need to install the necessary requirements and obtain any required API keys as detailed in the agent's documentation.</div>

      <div className="faqQuestion">What is the review and verification process for agents?</div>
