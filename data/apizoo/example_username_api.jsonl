    "description": "Silero Speech-To-Text models provide enterprise grade STT in a compact form-factor for several commonly spoken languages. The models are robust to a variety of dialects, codecs, domains, noises, and lower sampling rates. They consume a normalized audio in the form of samples and output frames with token probabilities. A decoder utility is provided for simplicity.",
