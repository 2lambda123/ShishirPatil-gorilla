## Introduction
We present Berkeley Function Leaderboard, the first comprehensive and executable function calling evaluation for LLMs function calling. Different from prior function calling evaluations (e.g. Anyscale function calling blog), we consider function callings of various forms, different function calling scenarios, and the executability of function calls. We also release our model Gorilla-Openfunctions-v2, the best open-source models so far to handle multiple languages of function calls, parallel function calls and multiple function calls. We also provide a specific debugging feature that when the provided function is not suitable for your task, the model will output an ‚ÄúError Message‚Äù.

## Berkeley Function Leaderboard Statistics

To generate leaderboard statistics, there are two steps:

1. Inference the evaluation data and obtain the results from specific models 

```bash
    python openfunctions_evaluation.py --model MODEL_NAME --test_category all --temperature 0.3
```

Running proprietary model like GPTs, Claude, Mistral-X will requires an API-Key which can be supplied in `openfunctions_evaluation.py`.

If decided to run OSS model, openfunctions evaluation uses vllm and therefore requires GPU for hosting and inferencing.

2. Check the accuracy of the evaluation result by our AST and Executable checks

```bash
    python openfunctions_checker.py --model MODEL_NAME --test_category {TEST_CATEGORY,all,ast,executable}
```
    
If you want to run the "all" or "executable" category, make sure to register your REST API keys in `function_credential_config.json`. This is because Gorilla Openfunctions Leaderboard want to test model's generated output on real world API! 

If you don't want to supply any API key, that's alright! Set `test_category` to `ast`. There, we are only doing the ast tree parsing and perform an exact match to derive the accuracy.

The output of this is in the format of 
```
Testing type: XXX, success rate: XXX
```

## Models Available
Below is a list of model we support to run our leaderboard evaluation against. If supported function calling, we will follow its function calling format provided by official documentations. Else, we will construct system message to prompt the model to generate function calls in the right format.
|Model | Function Calling |
|---|---|
|gorilla-openfunctions-v0 | Supported|
|gorilla-openfunctions-v2 | Supported|
|gpt-*| Supported|
|claude-*| Not supported|
|mistral-*| Not supported|
|Nexusflow-Raven-v2| Supported|
|deepseek-7b| Not supported|
|glaiveai| Not supported|
