Although the University of California system does not have an official flagship campus, many scholars and experts consider Berkeley to be its unofficial flagship. It shares this unofficial status with the University of California, Los Angeles. [ 35 ] In 1905, the University Farm was established near Sacramento, ultimately becoming the University of California, Davis. [ 36 ] In 1919, Los Angeles State Normal School became the southern branch of the university, which ultimately became the University of California, Los Angeles. [ 37 ] By the 1920s, the number of campus buildings in Berkeley had grown substantially and included twenty structures designed by architect John Galen Howard. [ 38 ] In 1917, one of the nation's first ROTC programs was established at Berkeley [ 39 ] and its School of Military Aeronautics began training pilots, including Jimmy Doolittle. In 1926, future Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz established the first Naval ROTC unit at Berkeley.

Weyand, sixteen other general officers, ten Navy flag officers, and AFROTC alumna Captain Theresa Claiborne.

In 1952, the university reorganized itself into a system of semi - autonom ous campuses, with each campus having its own chief executive, a chancellor, who would, in turn, report to the president of the university system. Twelve vice - chancellors report directly to Berkeley's chancellor, and the deans of the fifteen colleges and schools report to the executive vice chancellor and provos t, Berkeley's chief academic officer.
